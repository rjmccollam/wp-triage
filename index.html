		<h2>We All Need A Little Help Sometimes</h2>
		
		<img src="images/support.png" alt="WordPress Support" class="img-left">

		<p>Sure, WordPress can be fairly easy to use &mdash; but no matter what skill level you are, we all need a little help from time to time. You could try searching Google and you might find an answer to your question, but how do you know if it's right, and more importantly current? Wouldn't it be nice to pick up the phone or send an email to a WordPress expert that you trust? WP Triage gives you phone and email access to WordPress experts that can help you upgrade WordPress, install a plugin, help customize a theme, and so much more. We have worked with people of varying skill levels so no matter where your skills fall don't worry about it. We will save you time and headaches... trust us.</p>

	<section id="maintenance">

		<h2>We Sweat the Details...The Tech Details</h2>
		
		<img src="images/maintenance.png" alt="WordPress Support" class="img-right">

		<p>There are a lot of moving parts when it comes to managing a WordPress site between themes, plugins, hosting, domains, DNS, oh yea... and WordPress itself. How do you know it is safe to update that plugin or update that theme without losing any customizations you've made? Well, the short answer is that you don't, but WP Triage can help. We can manage the technical side of your WordPress site and let you get back to the fun stuff like writing content and interacting with your users. From themes and plugins to core WordPress updates, WP Triage will keep things running smoothly without blowing anything up!</p>

	<section id="backup">

		<h2>WordPress Backup</h2>
		
		<img src="images/backup.png" alt="WordPress Support" class="img-left">

		<p>Most of us use WordPress to power our very important website(s). It can be a little daunting to think that <em>'make one wrong move and POOF it could all be lost.'</em> Losing everything is certainly worst case scenario, but a bad plugin, or wrong move in your hosting control panel can cause some major issues that can take down your site. Backing up your site is crucial becuase, in the event that something terrible happens we can push a button (well, it's not quite that easy) and your site is back online as if nothing happened. WP Triage offers managed automatic daily backups with the ability to quickly restore your site if something was to go wrong.</p>

	<section id="migration">

		<h2>Server Migration</h2>
		
		<img src="images/migration.png" alt="WordPress Support" class="img-right">

		<p>One does not simply move a WordPress site from one server to another. There are a lot of details that must not be overlooked and a lot of technologies to be used that most WordPress users do not have experience with. We have been involved in moving basic sites as well as large sites that contained 1000's of posts from one server/domain to another. WP Triage will move your site from one host or domain to another successfully (it doesn't matter which host you use) and run the necessary checks to make sure everything is working as smoothly, if not more smoothly, than it was before.</p>
